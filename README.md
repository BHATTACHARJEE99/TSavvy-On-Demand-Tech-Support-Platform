# TSavvy-On-Demand-Tech-Support-Platform
TSavvy is a forward-thinking, app-based service platform designed to connect individuals and businesses with verified tech professionals for short-term, contract-based support.  Users can post real-time tech-related service requests, which are matched with professionals based on expertise and availability through a dynamic, user-friendly interface. The platform features a flexible pricing model that empowers users to adjust service rates to improve acceptance rates and service efficiency.
In addition to offering on-demand support, TSavvy integrates warehousing capabilities to equip professionals with necessary hardware and accessories. The platform also includes a commission-based model for tech professionals to earn on equipment sales, enhancing engagement and profitability. Trust and security are upheld through comprehensive background checks and a robust user rating system.
Throughout the development process, we utilized a variety of planning and design tools, including:
 
User Interface (UI) Diagrams to map and refine the appâ€™s layout and user interactions.
Use Case Diagrams to visualize system functionality and user interactions.
Data Model Diagrams to structure backend database relationships and ensure data integrity.
Gantt Charts for detailed project scheduling and task tracking.
Additional tools such as Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), Flowcharts, and Wireframes were employed to support collaborative development and streamline decision-making.
 
Led by an agile and solution-oriented team, TSavvy emphasizes innovation, scalability, and operational excellence in the tech support industry.
